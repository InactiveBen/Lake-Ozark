    bio: "Greetings! My name is Pastor Ron Trimmer, and I'm the senior minister at Lake Ozark Christian Church. I've been ministry for over twenty-five years, and I have been truly blessed by our God who allows me to take part in the amazing, life-giving work of Jesus Christ. I believe in a God of extravagant welcome, for the Lord loves each and every one of us, who is always inviting us to follow in the footsteps of Jesus Christ. God is still speaking, still moving, still creating and renewing in this world and in our lives. Our Lord continues to transform and resurrect, bringing grace and love, peace and justice, hope and new life. And our faith must propel us outside our doors to bring healing and love to this broken world. After being a widow for a few years after my first wife died of Ovarian cancer, I recently married Wendy, and we are blessed with four children, one of them still in high school. Wendy is a nurse practitioner at the OB/GYN Clinic at Lake Regional Hospital. Come and join us, for we welcome you on the journey of faith that you might experience the richness of God's blessings, the joy of service, and the hope of new life in Jesus Christ. Blessing and peace, Pastor Ron Trimmer",
