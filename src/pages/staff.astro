    bio: "Greetings! My name is Pastor Ron Trimmer, and I'm the senior minister at Lake Ozark Christian Church. I've been in ministry for over twenty years, and I have been truly blessed by our God who allows me to take part in the amazing, life-giving work of Jesus Christ. I believe in a God of extravagant welcome, for the Lord loves each and every one of us, who is always inviting us to follow in the footsteps of Jesus Christ. Our God is an active presence in our lives, still moving, still creating and renewing in this world and in our lives. Our Lord continues to transform and resurrect, bringing grace and love, peace and justice, hope and new life. And our faith must propel us outside our doors to bring healing and love to this broken world. I have two children, Ben and Aaron, one in high school and the other in middle school. My wife died of Ovarian cancer, leaving just the three of us. But by faith, we know of God's renewing love and life. Come and join us, for we welcome you on the journey of faith that you might experience the richness of God's blessings, the joy of service, and the hope of new life in Jesus Christ."
