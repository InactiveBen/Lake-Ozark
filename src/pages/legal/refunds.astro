<LegalLayout title="Refund Policy" lastUpdated="December 12, 2025" effectiveDate="December 12, 2025">

<div class="notice-box">
  <strong>ALL DONATIONS ARE FINAL.</strong> Please read this Refund Policy carefully before making a donation. By making a donation, you acknowledge and agree to the terms of this policy.
</div>

<h2>1. General Policy</h2>
<p>
  All donations made through the website and services (collectively, the <strong>"Services"</strong>) operated by <strong><a href="https://donorkit.com">DonorKit, Inc.</a></strong> ("Operator") on behalf of <strong>Lake Ozark Christian Church Inc.</strong>, a Missouri nonprofit corporation ("Organization"), are voluntary, irrevocable gifts. References to "we," "us," or "our" may refer to the Operator, the Organization, or both, as applicable. <strong>Donations are generally non-refundable.</strong> As a <strong>501(c)(3) nonprofit organization</strong>, donated funds are typically allocated to ministry operations, programs, and outreach efforts immediately upon receipt.
</p>
<p>
  The Organization reserves the sole and absolute discretion to determine whether a refund request will be granted. The approval of any refund request does not create a precedent or obligation to approve similar requests in the future.
</p>

<h2>2. Payment Processing</h2>
<p>
  All donations are processed by <strong><a href="https://donorkit.com">DonorKit, Inc.</a></strong> using <strong><a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe, Inc.</a></strong>'s secure payment platform. <strong>The Organization does not have direct access to your payment card numbers or bank account details</strong>, which are handled exclusively by DonorKit, Inc. and Stripe, Inc. Refund requests are processed through DonorKit's systems in coordination with Stripe.
</p>

<h2>3. Limited Refund Circumstances</h2>
<p>
  The Organization may, in its sole discretion, consider refund requests only in the following limited circumstances:
</p>

<h3>3.1 Duplicate Transactions</h3>
<p>
  If a verifiable duplicate transaction occurred (same amount, same payment method, same date) due to a technical error, the Organization may refund the duplicate charge upon verification.
</p>

<h3>3.2 Demonstrable Processing Errors</h3>
<p>
  If a demonstrable processing error resulted in an incorrect charge amount that differs significantly from the intended donation (e.g., an extra digit was added), the Organization may consider a partial or full refund. <strong>You must provide evidence of the intended donation amount.</strong>
</p>

<h3>3.3 Unauthorized Transactions</h3>
<p>
  If you believe a donation was made without your authorization due to theft, fraud, or unauthorized use of your payment method, you must: (a) contact us immediately; (b) provide documentation supporting your claim; and (c) file a report with your financial institution. The Organization will cooperate with reasonable investigations but makes no guarantee regarding refunds for claimed unauthorized transactions.
</p>

<h2>4. Refund Request Requirements</h2>

<h2>5. Refund Request Deadline</h2>

  <strong>Refund requests must be submitted within thirty (30) days of the original transaction date.</strong> Requests received after this period will be denied except in extraordinary circumstances as determined in our sole discretion. <strong>In no event will refund requests submitted more than ninety (90) days after the transaction date be considered.</strong>
