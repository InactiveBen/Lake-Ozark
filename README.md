## üìÅ Project Structure

Our codebase is organized into several key directories:

- `src/pages/`: The heart of our routing system
  - Contains `.astro` and `.md` files that automatically generate website routes
  - Each file corresponds to a page on the site
  - Markdown files power our content-heavy pages

- `src/components/`: Our component library
  - Houses reusable Astro components for consistent UI elements
  - Includes navigation, footer, cards, and other shared elements
  - Promotes maintainability and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles

- `src/layouts/`: Page templates and structures
  - Contains base layouts that wrap our pages
  - Ensures consistent styling and structure across the site
  - Handles common elements like headers and meta tags

- `public/`: Static asset storage
  - Stores images, fonts, and other unchanging files
  - Directly copied to the build directory
  - Optimized for performance and caching

- `src/styles/`: Global styling
